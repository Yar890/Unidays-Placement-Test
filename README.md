### How to build my program ###
The program I have made is written in C#.Net 7.0 and will be able to run on Visual Studio

### Approuch to the problem ###
My program has 3 classes:
- `Item`
- `Basket`
- `Discount`

#### Item Class ####
The item class is mainly used to store item information, such as item name, price and the type of discount it has. This class is mainly used for pricing rules, which is a dictionary that contains all the unique items that the shop has.
